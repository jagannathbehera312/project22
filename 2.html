            "IS IT REALLY POSSIBLE FOR HUMAN TO BE AN IMMORTAL ?"
            We have been hearing this question for last several years and everyone wants to know how is it possible or not? The only sure thing in life is that all of us one day will die. Humans have long been trying to achieve immortality, or at least live for 100 years and beyond. Some people think we're getting closer but we know all they do is only talking.
            But one fellow named Dr. John Cooke, department chair of cardiovascular sciences at Houston Methodist Research Institute, who is lead author of the paper published Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology has claimed that "we can make aged cells younger."
            Cooke's team targeted the telomeres of patients' cellsâ€”the caps at the ends of chromosomes whose length roughly corresponds to age. Telomeres are a favourite focus of the anti-aging community.Cooke's team used a technology called RNA therapeutics, which delivers RNA directly into cells, to spur cells to produce telomerase, a protein that lengthens telomeres. The technique improved cells' lifespan and function.So people have the disease called "progeria"where the cells become old before the age may be treated in this way.
            Though the reasearch has shown some remarkable evidence of making old cells younger ,but there are some critics about these findings.
            According to Dr. Peter Lansdorp, a professor of medical genetics at the University of British Columbia and scientist at the BC Cancer Agency, claims of telomere lengthening are mostly "snake oil." He explained that, despite the excitement, there's still a lot to learn.
            Telomeres do tend to shrink as we age, but it's not a perfect correlation, according to Lansdorp. "It is not hard to find a 70-year-old with longer telomeres than a teenager.Our cells stop dividing and die when telomeres become too short. If that didn't happen, it would put us at higher risk of developing cancer. 
            As for whether immortality is on the horizon, Lansdorp is skeptical. Immortality "is not a dream entertained by many serious scientists," he said. Our bodies are mortal by design, so we may just need to upload our minds.
            But some scientists are still hopeful about achieving immortality.
